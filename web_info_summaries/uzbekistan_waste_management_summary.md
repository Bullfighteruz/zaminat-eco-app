# Uzbekistan's Waste Management Landscape

Uzbekistan is in the process of reforming its waste management system to address growing environmental and public health concerns. The government has established a long-term strategy and is pursuing various initiatives, including public-private partnerships and legislative updates, to modernize its infrastructure and increase recycling rates.

## 1. Government Policies, Laws, and Strategies

Uzbekistan's national policy is centered around the **"Strategy for the Management of Solid Domestic Waste in the Republic of Uzbekistan for the period 2019-2028,"** adopted in April 2019 [ref: 0-1, 0-4]. This strategy outlines the country's long-term goals and is being implemented in two phases:
*   **Phase 1 (2019–2021):** Focused on reforming the legal framework and economic regulations in the waste management sector [ref: 0-4]. However, the implementation of this phase was deemed unsatisfactory [ref: 0-4].
*   **Phase 2 (2022–2028):** Aims to attract foreign investment to develop infrastructure for separate waste collection, optimize landfills, and build waste processing facilities [ref: 0-1, 0-4].

**Key Strategic Goals by 2028:**
*   Achieve 100% nationwide collection coverage for municipal solid waste [ref: 0-4].
*   Increase the overall sorting and recycling rate of municipal solid waste to 60% [ref: 0-3, 0-4].
*   Increase the volume of recycled specific waste, including tires (rubber) and packaging waste (plastic), to 25% [ref: 0-1, 0-4].
*   Reduce the volume of waste disposed of in landfills by 60% [ref: 0-4].

**Relevant Legislation and Principles:**
*   **Law "On Waste" (2002):** This is the foundational law, which was amended in 2019 to include a "utilization fee" for wheeled vehicles, self-propelled vehicles, and their trailers to ensure environmental safety [ref: 0-1].
*   **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):** Proposals have been made to formally incorporate the EPR principle into the Law "On Waste" and the national strategy [ref: 0-1]. EPR would extend a producer's responsibility to the post-consumer stage of a product's life cycle, including collection and disposal [ref: 0-1]. A new draft of the law includes proposed articles on EPR, environmental fees, and compensation payments [ref: 0-1].
*   **"Polluter Pays" Principle:** This is a core principle of the national strategy, aiming to create a legal and economic framework where waste producers bear the costs of management [ref: 0-1].
*   **Other Regulations:** A presidential decree mandates the separate collection and disposal of household waste [ref: 0-0]. Additionally, charges for plastic bags have been in effect since 2019, and preparations for a deposit-refund system for consumer packaging have begun [ref: 0-0, 0-4].

**Governing Bodies:**
Several national authorities regulate waste management, including the Cabinet of Ministers, the State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Health, and the State Agency "Kommunchizmat" [ref: 0-4]. State-owned enterprises "Makhsustrans" (in Tashkent) and "Tozakhudud" (in other regions) are responsible for waste disposal, though private companies have been permitted to operate since 2018 [ref: 0-4].

## 2. State of Waste Management Infrastructure

Uzbekistan's infrastructure is undergoing modernization, but significant gaps remain.
*   **Collection and Sorting:** In Tashkent, there are over 1100 waste collection and sorting facilities where operators perform sorting [ref: 0-0]. However, it is estimated that only 4-5% of potentially useful waste makes it to formal processing facilities, with a significant portion being sorted informally by sanitation workers and others [ref: 0-0]. Waste management services are not yet available in all of Uzbekistan's cities [ref: 0-4].
*   **Landfills:** The majority of waste is disposed of in landfills that do not meet sanitation standards [ref: 0-0]. The government plans to close 167 old landfills and construct 54 modernized and 5 new landfills by 2028 [ref: 0-4]. A new $17 million landfill, supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is under construction in Akhangaron and will feature modern environmental safeguards like methane gas collection pipes [ref: 0-0].
*   **Planned Upgrades:** The 2019-2028 strategy includes plans to introduce a separate waste collection system in urban residential areas between 2022 and 2025, using five types of marked containers for recyclable, organic, non-recyclable, hazardous, and glass waste [ref: 0-4].

## 3. Waste Generation and Recycling Statistics

Official statistics and reliable estimates on waste in Uzbekistan present a challenging picture.

| Parameter | Value / Status | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Annual Solid Household Waste Generation | Approximately 7 million tons | [ref: 0-0] |
| Projected Waste Generation | Expected to double by 2030 | [ref: 0-0] |
| Current Recycling/Treatment Rate | Varies by source: 32% (includes imported waste), 23% sorted/recycled, 19% treated | [ref: 0-0, 0-3, 0-4] |
| Useful Waste Reaching Processing | Only 4-5% of potentially useful waste reaches formal facilities | [ref: 0-0] |
| Strategic Recycling Goal (by 2028) | 60% of municipal solid waste | [ref: 0-3] |
| Goal for Plastic & Rubber (by 2028) | Increase recycling of tires and packaging waste to 25% | [ref: 0-1] |
| Collection Coverage | Not yet 100%; services are unavailable in some cities | [ref: 0-4] |
| Public Health Impact (2020) | Over 340 deaths linked to diseases from household waste pollution | [ref: 0-0] |

## 4. State-Sponsored Programs and Financial Incentives

The government is actively promoting investment and participation in the waste management sector through various programs.

*   **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):** The government is actively seeking PPPs with experienced companies to modernize the sector [ref: 0-3]. Since 2018, landfill sites can be allocated to private enterprises through PPP contracts awarded via electronic tender [ref: 0-4].
*   **Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Projects:** Uzbekistan is investing $1.3 billion in WtE projects with international partners, including companies from China, the UAE, and South Korea [ref: 0-2]. These projects aim to process 4.7 million metric tons of solid waste annually and generate 2.1 billion kWh of electricity by 2027 [ref: 0-2]. Separately, a South Korean company is investing $55 million to produce electricity from waste gases at two landfills [ref: 0-0].
*   **Financial Incentives for Businesses:**
    *   Tax and customs exemptions are available for companies that provide efficient waste management solutions [ref: 0-3].
    *   Foreign direct investments in waste management services are eligible for tax advantages (e.g., exemption from property and wealth tax), with the duration of benefits (3 to 7 years) depending on the investment amount [ref: 0-4].
    *   Tax incentives and loans were offered to waste-related enterprises in 2022 [ref: 0-0].
*   **Pilot Programs and Initiatives:**
    *   In 2020, UNDP, the Tashkent city administration, and Makhsustrans ran a successful pilot project to encourage waste sorting in a Tashkent neighborhood by providing color-coded containers, though its expansion was hindered by the pandemic [ref: 0-0].
    *   Between 2017 and 2018, 13 state unitary enterprises and nine private entrepreneurial "clusters" were established to improve waste management [ref: 0-0].
*   **Challenges:** Despite these initiatives, challenges persist. Many waste sorting projects have been discontinued [ref: 0-0]. A significant issue is the low collection rate for mandatory waste fees, which stands at just 30-40% outside of Tashkent, leading to large debts for waste enterprises [ref: 0-0].
